Format:
Probably best as webapp
Does need to calculate based on user input --> need processing power.
  -> So website cannot be static, or it has to be a desktop app.

Features:
  -Hitrate depending on different metrics:
    Burst length
    -distance
    -weapon stats
    -ideal bust length and pattern
    -practical TTK
      -with comparison between weapons
      -graphs

function for a shot simulation
	-print hitrate for evey bullet in burst
	  *run simulation for hitrate_sim_count times, store info if nth bullet is a hit,
    	sum up each bullet amount of hits/misses, give percentage
			need one var for each shot of the burst within simulation function, 
      another set for each shot to add 0 or 1 to,
			so 1 for every hit and 0 for every miss. 
      then get change by division by hitrate_sim_count
		*max burst lenght?
	-burstlenght

Math:
  Hitrate:
  -target size?
    -circle?
  -equation for hitrate?
  -base area of cone/radius of cone base
  -distance
  -HREC
  //Base of the Spread(circle) overlaps with target(circle)
  //need to find out overlap between the two. Using the area of the
    cirlces?
  //HREC will shit the Spread circle an amount to left or right.
  //HREC is an angle, so shift of spread will depend on distance
  //HREC is right-angled triangle. Angle at top given by HREC.
    //Height given by distance to target
    //so use Tangens
    //baselength of that triangle is distance for the spread shift
TO DO:
-create function for shot simulation
