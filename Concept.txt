Format:
Probably best as webapp
Does need to calculate based on user input --> need processing power.
  -> So website cannot be static, or it has to be a desktop app.

Features:
  -Hitrate depending on different metrics:
    -Burst length
    -distance
    -weapon stats
  -ideal bust length and pattern
  -practical TTK
    -with comparison between weapons
    -graphs

  Math:
    Hitrate:
      -target size?
        -circle?
      - equation for hitrate?
        -base area of cone/radius of cone base
        -distance
        -HREC
        //Base of the Spread(circle) overlaps with target(circle)
        //need to find out overlap between the two. Using the area of the cirlces?
        //HREC will shit the Spread circle an amount to left or right.
        //HREC is an angle, so shift of spread will depend on distance
        //HREC is right-angled triangle. Angle at top given by HREC.
          //Height given by distance to target
          //so use Tangens
          //baselength of that triangle is distance for the spread shift
